What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
Interesting Code to make gravity.
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 It reflects the theme by imitating the rush to grab toilet paper once the virus started just as other people did.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
A final score on the screen after the game was over.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Improve the hit boxes for the viruses. Many were hard to jump over and killed you when they were not visibly touching you.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
There was nothing that really confused me.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes, the roles of the people are included in the readme.

Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I thought their readme was quite well done and explained a lot about the struggles and creation of their project.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

I enjoyed playing it a couple times until I could reach the end. Felt like cat mario a bit.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
4, good job.
