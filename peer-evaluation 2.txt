What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

I think this is one of the best examples of a 2D platformer I've seen created by someone not in a major game studio, and I learned a lot from the overall finished product. 

 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

The game is a platformer in which you are tasked with gathering rolls of toilet paper while avoiding spores of the virus. 

 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

I think this game is very "juicy". The sound effects, animations for items and the protagonist, the background, the art, and the menu are all great examples of how to elevate a simple game into something much more impressive. I will definitely look to create something like this in my future game projects. 
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

There were a few times where it seemed like the virus' collision was a bit off from the actual shape of the virus itself, but this was not a constant issue.

 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

No, most of the code was very straightforward. 


Is it clear that every group member participated?

Yes, and the README clearly states who did what. 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes. 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

I had trouble viewing screenshots, so maybe a formatting issue could be resolved to prevent that. 


Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

This game is overall great. I am especially impressed by the artwork, which is absolutely fantastic. Everything about this game has polish and finesse and I actually had fun playing it. Great job. 

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?

4/5 points.
